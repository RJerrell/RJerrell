- 👋 Hi, I’m @RJerrell
- I'm 75 years++ (get it?) old but I've still got a fire burning inside to make the programming world a safer better place.
- 👀 I’m interested in learing professional coding skills in several languages in particular C#, F#, Python, and more pointedly ML and languages associated with TensonFlow.
- 🌱 At my core, I'm Microsoft stack programmer looking to find equivalent skills in other languages.
- Professionally I'm an industry expert in the topic of S1000D and how orgranizations building products for air, sea, and land can make use of the spcecifications defined in S1000D.
- Constructs like LINQ, LINQ.XML, IENUMERABLE<T> , CLASS GENERICS, INTERFACES, DESIGN PATTERNS that solve business problems are several of the facets in code that I'm interested in.
- I'm interested in best practices for mapping XML to PDF documents and documentation that contains both wrtten text and media types like pics, svg, mpeg, etc. for publishing conetent.
- 💞️ I’m looking to establish a common set of tools to manage S1000D documents OUTSIDE a CSDB
